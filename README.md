# Automated Watering System for Greenhouses


Greenhouses are rooms to store plants that allow light in via glass walls and a glass roof. The aspects of growing plants can be measured, for example soil humidity and temperature. All these temperatures are used to calculate a when the plants should be watered. Automated plant watering is better because the water can be given to the plants at a more accurate time and the farmer has one less task to do meaning he has more time for other tasks. This into software that is viewable on a tablet in the greenhouse or a phone for example. What is required of the project: 

Different parts of the software:
*An alarm for when the water tank which the water pumps use are empty. The farmer can then refill the tank which turns of the alarm
*Second sensor for each plant to ensure the sensors are working correctly
Sensors and devices used:
*temperature sensor
*humidity sensor
*Water level sensor
*Humidity sensor
*alarm
*Water pump
*Device to view the software on
*Fan
*Ultrasonic sensor
*Ultrasonic mole deterrant
*Steam sensor
*Moisture sensor
Potential sensors and devices used:
*Solar panel
*Heater


Potential features:
*Internal and external sensors for temperature
* Ultrasonic sensor to detect animals trying to damage the plant
* Being able to detect the difference between a human hand and an animal
* Scaring voles away using ultrasonic mole deterant
* Solar panels as a backup power source for areas where the primary source is not always availabe (for example the country has bad infrastructure) or primary source for off-the-grid farmers 

Uses of the software:
*Viewing all the values such as temperature seperately
*showing the farmer how dry the soil is which allows the farmer to monitor if the plants are being watered correctly, otherwise they would have to blindly trust the system
*When will the plants need watering next
*Is there likely to be any out of the ordinary weather events to be aware of, for example a storm blowing over the greenhouse and destroying the plants.
*If there is any hardware that breaks it needs to be added to the system
*Manual adjustment of the water pump to suit the farmers needs
*Adding more sensors after initial installation of the greenhouse
